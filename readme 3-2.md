# Homework 3-2

**Introduction**
-
This code is written in Python 3.7.0 64-bit

**Explanation of the Code**
-
This code is extended from the code of previous question. I create four lists(new_list1, new_list5, 
new_list10, new_list20) and give them new attribute value randomly choosed from 0 to 1.

Moreover, I create four functions based on perceptron learning and four new initial number lists for each new_lists. Although the method looks a little bit stupid, the totally five for-loops (including original data which have five attribures) give us a result of how many number of example-presentations of each learning process are.

Last but not least, I print out the final weights of the attributes of 5 classifiers. In addition, the numbers of example-presentations of five perceptron learning processes is put into "h_c" list.(5 attributes, 6 attributes, 10 attributes, 15 attributes, 25 attributes )
